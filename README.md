# Lambda at home

## Deploy serverless function _on a server_

#### whoami

Remember when Heroku was a viable thing, before Salesforce bought it and went `hm yes this platform that was specfically tailored for small scale projects with solo developers to make them easier to deploy would work way better as a very expensive kubernetes service that nobody asked for`? 

Have you ever wanted to run something on aws, but it was not written in one of the like 5 stacks they support on lambdas, or it was but you used a framework and didn't feel like rewriting the route handling?

Have you ever used GCP cloud run and realized it was actually pretty good, I really have no complaints about this one tbh.

Do you have $5 to spend on a VPS and just not worry about scaling lambda costs?
